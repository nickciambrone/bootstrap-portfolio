                        <img src="photo.jpg" alt="selfie" height="135" width="165" style="float: left;">My name is Nicholas Ciambrone and I am currently studying Business Analytics Information & Technology
                        at Rutgers Business School.I am currently studying at the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp in hopes of one
                        day creating my own website.
                        <br>
                        <br> I had an idea for a website in highschool that I had always thought would be cool, and hoped one
                        day someone would make it. In college I was introduced to coding in in a class called "Computer Applications
                        for Business", and I decided to BE the change I wanted to see in the world and one day create the
                        website that I imagined in high school.
                        <br>
                        <br> After graduating I want to be a software engineer and work on side projects for additional income.
                        I hope to work at a highly regarded company like Amazon or Google.
